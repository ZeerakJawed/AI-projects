# HeartDiseasePrediction
There are two files in this repository, one for a prediction using a deep-learning architecture and the other using a Machine Learning model. 
### To run the file
You can download the file and open it in your Jupyter Notebook environment. Alternatively, you can click the  ''open in Colab'' link at the top of the notebook to open the file directly in Google Colab and run the cells. 

### Improving the models
Feel free to play around with the models, e.g. Hyperparameter tuning or a different model, to increase the accuracy score. 

### Using your own dataset.
You can simply upload your on-file and change the value of df to that. 
When it comes to scaling and standardizing the variables, you may need to change the variables in the code cells. And depending on what variables you have, you may need to remove some variables from the code cells. 
I highly encourage you to use the models with your own dataset and see the performance. 

### Understanding the Data and Closing remarks
I have carried out exploratory data analysis on the dataset used for this prediction task. In the notebook, you may see some text in the text cells and or as comments within the code cells. These were the highlights of my thought process as I was exploring the dataset. I write them to guide my exploration process and ensure I don't lose my thoughts. I may share the document presenting my analysis in detail. However, the main concept I am trying to showcase here is how AI can be utilised to learn a pattern in a given dataset and output key information that we can use to make imperative decisions either for business or even personal needs. In the case of this project, we have a heart disease predictor in which we can input our values for each variable and see if we are at risk of developing a heart disease or not.
